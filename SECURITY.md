## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of BugHunter GPT seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [your-security-email@example.com]. You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

* We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours
* We will provide a more detailed response within 72 hours, indicating the next steps in handling your report
* We will handle your report with strict confidentiality and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission
* We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
* After the initial reply to your report, we will endeavor to keep you informed about our progress
* We will credit you as the discoverer of the bug (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
* Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
* Do not exploit a security issue for purposes other than verification
* Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly
* Do not use automated tools to find vulnerabilities
